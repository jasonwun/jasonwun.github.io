## What I've really done today
### Think Category
#### Ask Lee more about the asynchrounous job of Background work item
He didn't reply me more since afternoon. I'm not sure he approve the idea or not
#### Reply PR comment
He has no more answer. I assume he approve the logic
#### Ask Denice more about the issue of ISO Load Zone Column meaning
So after I told Denice that ISO Load Zone table has mapped the Capacity Zone already, she wait for approving of the new template design. I would put this task into tomorrow as well
#### Ask using Pivot in store proc
I'm not sure whether it is the right way to do it to get the Capacity Auction Result data using only one stored procedure. This task will delay into tomorrow

### Implement Category
### Complete Stored Procedure based on current table design
Every thing else rather than GetData as we need to whether should I split one stored procedure to two to get all data set
