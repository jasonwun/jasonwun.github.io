### Implement Category
#### Adjust Meter Read Cycle Cycle code value storing logic

## What I've really done today
### Think Category
#### Revisit the MKT-831 requirement 
So basically MKT-831 is a ticket for UI mostly and the only thing is to make sure the it is going to pass correct value into backend

### Implement Category
### Adjust Meter Read Cycle Cyclde code 
Tony sent me the ticket late afternoon and I refactored the code and created a PR for it.

*** 

## What Left?

Currently the only issue is that Capacity Auction Result's business logic is not settle down and it last a week for this ticket. I assume I suppose to assure something tomorrow otherwise it takes too long and people wait. But as long as it is settled down, it should be done real quick

Second thing is that MKT-831 is a relativly simple task. And if Capacity Auction Result is not settle down tomorrow then I could finish this ticket first
